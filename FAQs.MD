# FAQs for bilingual annotation

1. Some of my clips don’t have too much speech. Is that a mistake?
No, that’s ok- some recordings have a lot of speech while others only have a few seconds of speech. The percentage of speech will be recorded as data for each clip. If a clip doesn’t have any speech mark “no speech” under “Language” and move on.  


2. What speaker do I select if there isn’t any speech in the clip?
Just ignore speaker selection. You only need to select “No speech” under “Language” and you can move to the next clip. 

3. Do I need to differentiate the language of the media? (Quechua, Spanish, mixed?)
No, because most of the time it’s too hard to tell. Just check “media” and move on. If there isn’t any speech in besides to the media, mark “no speech.”

4. What speaker do I select if the target child and another child talk during the clip?
“Target Child & Other Child.” “Other Child” is only selected if another child besides the target child is the only speaker in the clip. 

5. What do I mark if the speech is too faint to make out speakers or languages? 
Mark “Unsure”

6. Does music count as “Media”?
Yes

7. What do I select if another child (but not the target child) and an adult talk during the clip?
“Other Child and Adult”

8. I made a mistake! Can I change my annotation?
Yes, look in the terminal and note the clip number. Then, go into the responses.csv and edit that annotation. Be sure to use the same text (caps when necessary, don’t add spaces)

9. What if I hear Meg talking in the clip? 
Mark “Researcher” under “Speaker” and leave “Language” alone (as “Categorize language”)

10. One of my clips is less than 30 seconds. What’s wrong?
This is probably an “end clip” - the remainder after the rest of the recording had been divided into 30 second chunks. Just classify as best you can. 

11. How do I classify crying, moaning, coughing, laughing, etc. if there is no other speech in the clip?
“No speech”

12. The app froze!
Just kill it in the terminal and run again. Your responses have been saved!

13. How do I classify vocalizations from the child? Particularly younger children sometimes say syllables like “ba ba” which are neither Quechua nor Spanish but are certainly speech. 
Mark “Unsure” under Language and the appropriate speakers. 

14. Does live music count as “Media?”
No. Ignore it. 

15. How do we classify children’s word play? (i.e. we can’t understand the language but the child is definitely producing words, rhymes, etc.)
Mark “Unsure” under Language and the appropriate speakers. 

16. How do I classify a clip when the child is speaking, and I understand their language, but I faintly hear adults/other people in the background who I don’t understand/can’t determine the language?
Ignore the speakers in the background if you would have to mark “unsure” for their speaker label and language. Classify the child’s language and mark “child” as speaker. 

17. What do I select if another child, the target child, and an adult talk during the clip?
“Target Child & Adult” - basically, ignore the other child
